Design Pattern Implementation
-----------------------------------------------------------
Object-oriented design pattern: For my object-oriented design pattern, 
I have implemented an a behavioral design pattern. 
This pattern allows different user types to easily login regardless of 
their usertype. The classes that are integral to this design pattern are 
the User, UserType, and LoginController classes. 

User Interface Design Pattern: 

The user interface design pattern that I have implemented is a captcha.
This design pattern allows for the user to be verified before
they login. This pattern is implemented in the LoginUI and LoginController
classes. The methods that run this pattern are the requestVerify and 
actionPerformed method that is part of the captchaVerify action listener.
