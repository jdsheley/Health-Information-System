Object-Oriented Design Pattern:
The design pattern I chose was Facade, which is a structural type. The intent was to simplify accessing sets of stored
data. I applied this in the PatientList class, where it accesses the list of users in order to have a list of users
that are patients. Therefore, these users who possess the same types of data will be able to be referenced separately
from the other types of users.
Involved Classes: PatientList and UserList

User Interface Pattern
The user interface design pattern I chose was to have a Table Filter. With this, sorting through and finding the
correct patients in the database will be easier. This comes into form as a table that lists the patients. These
patients would be able to be selected in order to view their information in a more detailed manner.
Involved Classes: PatientTableUI, PatientTableModel, PatientTableController
